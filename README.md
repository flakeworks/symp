# 🌌 Symp

**Framework from a parallel reality where symbols won.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📜 What is Symp?

In our timeline, computing rushed toward pixels, sound, and spectacle.
But in another world, history diverged. There, operating systems never
left the monochrome console --- and yet, the **theory of symbols
advanced centuries ahead**.

**Symp** is not just a programming language. It is an **artifact from
that reality**:
a symbolic kernel where all computation flows through three hidden
pillars:

-   **Symbolmatch** → syntax as grammar.
-   **Symbolverse** → semantics as rewriting.
-   **Symbolprose** → execution as graphs.

Atop them sits **Symbolfront**, the user's portal: an S-expression form
of Markdown, a symbolic page system.
Together they form **symbol-os**: an alternate-universe operating
system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🌀 What makes Symp different?

-   Programs are not *written*. They are **rewritten**.
-   Execution is not a black box --- it's a **graph of edges and
    instructions**.
-   Documents are not plain text --- they are **symbolic pages**,
    capable of hosting both explanation and computation.
-   The shell is not a utility belt --- it is **Symbolshell**, a
    lightweight scripting framework built from the very pillars of
    symbolic logic.

## 🖥️ Example Session

``` lisp
; A rewrite: does x*x equal x^2?
(APPLY symbolverse (eq (mul x x) (pow x 2)))

[SYMBOLVERSE]
 Rule applied: (mul x x) → (pow x 2)
 Result: (eq (pow x 2) (pow x 2))
```

``` lisp
; A simple page in Symbolfront
(APPLY symbolfront
  (DOC
    (TITLE "Distributive Law")
    (PARA "We show how implication distributes.")
    (CODE (impl (impl p (impl q r))
                (impl (impl p q) (impl p r))))
    (FOOT "Generated by Symp")))
```

Rendered output:

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────
     Distributive Law

     We show how implication distributes.

       (impl (impl p (impl q r))
             (impl (impl p q) (impl p r)))

## 🔮 The Vision

**v01**: Symp begins as a **minimalist symbolic kernel** (*symbolback*).  
**v03**: It grows into a full-stack framework (*symbolfull*).  
**v05**: And finally, it awakens as **symbol-os**: a chat-like monochrome
operating system from the world where **symbols won**.
